class ProofOfStakePulse:
    """
    Proof of Stake Pulse (PoSP) Implementation
    
    A lightweight consensus mechanism that combines the security of PoS
    with the efficiency of pulse-based verification.
    
    Key features:
    - Lightweight pulse verification instead of heavy hash calculations
    - Stake-weighted validator selection with reputation factors
    - Millisecond-level transaction finality
    - Adaptive security parameters based on network conditions

class LoadBasedSharding:
    """
    Load-Based Dynamic Sharding Implementation
    
    Automatically adjusts shard allocation based on real-time node load
    to optimize network performance.
    
    Key features:
    - Real-time monitoring of node CPU, memory, and network load
    - Dynamic shard splitting and merging based on load thresholds
    - Region-based initial shard allocation for low latency
    - Cross-shard transaction coordination with minimal overhead

class SoftSyncProtocol:
    """
    SoftSync Protocol Implementation
    
    A lightweight synchronization protocol that minimizes bandwidth usage
    by transmitting only essential pulse data between nodes.
    
    Key features:
    - Minimal data transfer (1/10 of traditional protocols)
    - Pulse-based verification instead of full block propagation
    - Efficient peer discovery and connection management
    - Prioritized data transmission based on network conditions

    PulseChain 1.0 Implementation
    
    A revolutionary blockchain platform combining Proof of Stake Pulse (PoSP),
    load-based dynamic sharding, and SoftSync protocol for optimal performance
    on standard hardware.
    
    Key features:
    - 100,000 TPS through parallel processing across dynamic shards
    - Millisecond transaction finality with lightweight pulse verification
    - Runs efficiently on standard consumer hardware (4GB RAM, 4 cores)
    - Regional sharding for optimal latency and throughput
    - Minimal bandwidth usage through the SoftSync protocol
